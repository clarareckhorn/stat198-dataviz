## We live surrounded by graphics! {.smaller}
- This has not always been the case
- Our parent's generation had no immediate access to graphics
- Graphics we can easily get access to:
  - Credit score (donut chart/timeline)
  - Number of commits to a GH repo (tiles graph)
  - Google maps timeline (map)
  - Score distribution of an exam (histogram)
  - ETC

# Visual Literacy
- Nowadays: very easy to access graphical displays of any kind of data
- Consumers of data viz
- We lack formal education in visual literacy 
- This course: a solid foundation in visual literacy involving both the consumption and production of graphics

# Why are we teaching this class?
- Brainchild of Prof. Sanchez (Statistics Faculty Member) who is passionate about all things data viz
- Stats dept has no dedicated data viz course, so Prof Sanchez decided to put together materials for 1 semester course
- Offered: fall 2023, spring 2024, fall 2024... restructred for this semester!

# Your introductions

## Activity: Introduce yourself!
Before course logistics, we would like to get to know a bit about you. 
- Grab a "Hello My Name Is" sticker from the front table

`{{< countdown "2:00" >}}`

## Tell us: 
- Your name
- Your major/area of study
- Why are you taking this class?
- Your favorite data vizualization (if you have one!) or the last graphic you saw in the last week 
- Your favorite color 

`{{< countdown "5:00" >}}`

## Activity: Two truths and a lie
- Think of two truths and one lie about yourself 
- Share with a partner and have them guess which one is the lie

`{{< countdown "5:00" >}}`

## Activity: Repeating names
- Take turns saying your names in order
- Each person must repeat the names of everyone who came before them
- If you mess up, start over!

## Activity
- Grab a piece of scratch paper and write something unique and interesting about yourself
- This is private and only for us to get to know you better 

`{{< countdown "3:00" >}}`

## Activity: Gathering data {.smaller}

(to be used in week 3 activity)

- Transfer T/F
- Favorite drink (water, tea, coffee, etc)
- Major
- Average amount of sleep on weekdays (Number)
- Distance from where you grew up (in approx miles)
- Units you are taking this semester
- Number of siblings 

`{{< countdown "3:00" >}}`

## How would you portray this data? {.smaller}
- Group activity (3-4 people)
Each group will have to brainstorm on a paper for Graphs that students create/guess based on a primary variable “Hours of Sleep of a Berkeley student (Stereotype)” together with Secondary variables:
- Year: Freshman, Sophomore, Junior, Senior (e.g. Bar chart, Pie)
- Enrolled units: Unit counts (e.g. Scatter plot)
- Sex or Gender: Female Vs. Male (e.g. Bar chart, Pie)
- Months (e.g. Line graph)
Combine all variables (e.g. or at least three in one graph)?

{{< countdown "10:00" >}}`

## How would you portray this data? (continued) {.smaller}
On a poster, make 4 graphs to visualize your thoughts on these categories
- Extra challenge: make a creative graph that will show 3 variables of the 4 that we gave them
