Doing so doesn’t help them; it just sets them up for trouble. Feel free to discuss approaches to the problems with others, but you must write your own solutions. Please complete your own work and keep it to yourself. If you suspect other people may be plagiarizing you, let us know ASAP. For more information please read the Honor Code Guide for Syllabi.\nWe expect you to do your own work and to uphold the standards of intellectual integrity. Collaborating on homework is fine and I encourage you to work together—but copying is not, nor is having somebody else submit assignments for you. Cheating will not be tolerated. Anyone found cheating will receive an NP grade and will be reported to the Center for the Student Conduct).\nAs for AI, our policy is that it is acceptable to use as a tool and even encouraged occasionally, as long as it does not interfere with your learning of the materials. We encourage its use as a tutor or for small questions, but not for writing entire pieces of code. You will be quizzed in class and those quizzes will be a large portion of your grade, so understanding the material and being able to synthesize code on your own is essential.\nIf you are having trouble with an assignment or studying for an exam, or if you are uncertain about permissible and impermissible conduct or collaboration, please come see me with your questions. Rather than copying someone else’s work, ask for help. You are not alone in this course! If you invest the time to learn the material and complete the projects, you won’t need to copy any answers.",

However, data visualization is not just about knowing how to use tools or software to produce a graphic. Quoting Donna Wong again:\n\n“With computer technology, anyone can create graphics, but few of us know how to do it well.”\n\nData visualization is also about having a critical mindset, and acquiring the training not just to produce effective graphics, but also to learn how to assess a visual display of data.\nTo us, data visualization entails both the production as well as the consumption of graphics. Those of us who deal with data, sooner or later have to produce charts and graphs, and we have to be prepared to do this task effectively. Likewise, some of us will have to create graphics on a constant basis, some periodically, and some very rarely. However, all of us will be consuming visual displays of data. Therefore, we also need to be able to critically assess a graphic, and also know how to do it well.\nIn summary, our aim is to provide students the fundamental principles to:\n\nProduce effective graphics, and\nAssess the effectiveness of a visual display of data.",
