However, data visualization is not just about knowing how to use tools or software to produce a graphic. Quoting Donna Wong again:\n\n“With computer technology, anyone can create graphics, but few of us know how to do it well.”\n\nData visualization is also about having a critical mindset, and acquiring the training not just to produce effective graphics, but also to learn how to assess a visual display of data.\nTo us, data visualization entails both the production as well as the consumption of graphics. Those of us who deal with data, sooner or later have to produce charts and graphs, and we have to be prepared to do this task effectively. Likewise, some of us will have to create graphics on a constant basis, some periodically, and some very rarely. However, all of us will be consuming visual displays of data. Therefore, we also need to be able to critically assess a graphic, and also know how to do it well.\nIn summary, our aim is to provide students the fundamental principles to:\n\nProduce effective graphics, and\nAssess the effectiveness of a visual display of data.",

While the RGB model has very interesting mathematical properties, it does not provide a natural/intuitive way to think about color.\nIn this unit, we discuss another theory for color vision: the so-called Color-Opponent theory. This alternative framework was originally proposed by Karl Ewald Hering in 1892, based on evidence from color-adaptation experiments and the linguistic observation of certain color names.\nThe opponent-color theory suggests that the way we perceive color is controlled by 3 opposing systems (or channels) in our vision:\n\nRed-Green\nBlue-Yellow\nBlack-White\n\nInterestingly, the color models associated with the opponent-color theory have a cylindrical geometry instead of the cubic space of RGB.\nMore important, the main practical tools that emanate from this color theory are 1) the famous color wheel, and 2) the color-picker devices.\n\n\n\nAt the end of this unit you will be able to:\n\nExplain the Color-Opponent theory of color vision.\nDescribe what color models are typically used in color-picker tools.\nExplain the color wheel.\nName at least three different color schemes derived from the color wheel, and what characterizes them.\n\n\n\n\n\nOpponent-Color Theory (google slides)\nCylindric Color Modelx (google slides)\n\n\n\n\nTBA\n\n\n\n\nTBA",

One important property is color. Consequently we need to spend time talking about encoding data with color. Depending on the type of variables we are wroking with, and their associated measurement scales, colors can be used to encode such values. Therefore, we need to discuss which kinds of colors are more appropriate for encoding which types of variables.\n\n\n\nAt the end of this unit you will be able to:\n\nUnderstand the default behavior of ggplot when a variable is mapped to a color attribute.\nIndicate what color scale ggplot uses when you map a logical variable.\nIndicate what color scale ggplot uses when you map an integer variable.\nIndicate what color scale ggplot uses when you map a factor variable.\nIndicate what color scale ggplot uses when you map a double variable.\n\n\n\n\n\nColor Pickers, Color Wheel, and Color Schemes (google slides)\n\n\n\n\nTBA\n\n\n\n\nTBA",

    "text": "In this week, we’ll continue talking about color, specifically about the opponent color theory and cylindrical models, and you will turn in HW3 (Friday 11:59pm).\nLast time we learned about the Trichromatic theory for color vision, and the associated RGB color model and its cubic geometric representation. While the RGB model has very interesting mathematical properties, it does not provide a natural/intuitive way to think about color.\nIn this unit, we discuss another theory for color vision: the so-called Color-Opponent theory. This alternative framework was originally proposed by Karl Ewald Hering in 1892, based on evidence from color-adaptation experiments and the linguistic observation of certain color names.\nThe opponent-color theory suggests that the way we perceive color is controlled by 3 opposing systems (or channels) in our vision:\n\nRed-Green\nBlue-Yellow\nBlack-White\n\nInterestingly, the color models associated with the opponent-color theory have a cylindrical geometry instead of the cubic space of RGB.\nMore important, the main practical tools that emanate from this color theory are 1) the famous color wheel, and 2) the color-picker devices.\n\n\n\nAt the end of this unit you will be able to:\n\nExplain the Color-Opponent theory of color vision.\nDescribe what color models are typically used in color-picker tools.\nExplain the color wheel.\nName at least three different color schemes derived from the color wheel, and what characterizes them.\n\n\n\n\n\nOpponent-Color Theory (google slides)\nCylindric Color Modelx (google slides)\n\n\n\n\nTBA\n\n\n\n\nTBA",

    "text": "In this week, we’ll continue talking about color, specifically about the use of color in data viz, and you will turn in HW4 (Friday 11:59pm).\nIn addition to color models (and their spaces), another important aspect of color has to do with its actual use when making graphics.\nRecall that making graphics, conceptually speaking, is basically mapping data to geometric objects and their visual properties. One important property is color. Consequently we need to spend time talking about encoding data with color. Depending on the type of variables we are wroking with, and their associated measurement scales, colors can be used to encode such values. Therefore, we need to discuss which kinds of colors are more appropriate for encoding which types of variables.\n\n\n\nAt the end of this unit you will be able to:\n\nUnderstand the default behavior of ggplot when a variable is mapped to a color attribute.\nIndicate what color scale ggplot uses when you map a logical variable.\nIndicate what color scale ggplot uses when you map an integer variable.\nIndicate what color scale ggplot uses when you map a factor variable.\nIndicate what color scale ggplot uses when you map a double variable.\n\n\n\n\n\nColor Pickers, Color Wheel, and Color Schemes (google slides)\n\n\n\n\nTBA\n\n\n\n\nTBA",
